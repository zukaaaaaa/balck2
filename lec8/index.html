            <p class="info">I received a job offer mid-course, 
                and the subjects I learned were current, if not
                 more so, in the company I joined.
                 I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>

                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                 I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
                  heard some people who had an amazing experience 
                  here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                   found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                    thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
                      best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                       Since completing the course,
                        I’ve  successfully switched careers,
                 working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                 really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                 I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn 
                 programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                 student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                  The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                   hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                     next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
                      I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my 
                      developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a 
                full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!  ”
